Cloud computing is an essential component for our modern digital society, given that it supports the marjority of service and applications we use. On the other hand, one cannot neglect the environental impact it presents, which originates both from the energy consumption of its operation --- higher than the electricity demand of entire countries --- and the life cycle of its infrastructure.

In this thesis, we studied strategies to reduce the environmental impact --- in terms of carbon footprint --- of both operating and sizing cloud federations with data centers geographically distributed over the world. More specifically, we explored two strategies that are carbon-responsive: ``follow-the-renewables'' and the sizing of the renewable infrastructure and IT equipment.

This chapter begins by providing an overview of the main contributions made in this thesis, which can be found in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion_summary}. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion_future_research} it presents potential opportunities for future research directions that build upon the insights derived from the work presented in this thesis. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion_dissemination} presents the various ways in which our work has been disseminated, including a list of scientific publications that have emerged from the research conducted in this thesis.


\section{Summary of contributions }

\label{sec:conclusion_summary}

The first main contribution of this thesis is the analysis of the impact of the follow-the-renewables strategy in both energy consumption and network --- presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:smartgreens}. This approach is an interesting solution to exploit the geographic distribution of the cloud data centers over the world to reduce the high-carbon intensive electricity consumption. However, the decision to migrate the workload needs to consider the resources involved in this operation --- specially the network. We demonstrated through computational experiments using real world data for workload, climate conditions, validated models by the scientific comunity for energy consumption and network usage, and different approaches proposed by the that adopts follow-the-renewable in different ways that the migration planing without taking into account the network --- in particular the network topology and the usage --- will result in network congestion and wastage of energy. As seen in Section~\ref{sec:wasted_resources_smartgreens}, the energy wasted could even be used to power the cloud federation, and it also contributes to increase the environmental impact of the data centers operation. We proposed an algorithm for the migration planning that can reduce the non-renewable energy consumption while not impacting the network in comparison to works from the literature that schedule the workload migration without taking into account the network.


The second main contribution of this thesis our modeling to both size the renewable and IT infrastructure, and operate cloud federations that could be adopted by decision makers to guide their efforts to reduce the environmental impact of cloud federations --- presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:ccgrid} and Chapter~\ref{chap:ccgrid-extension}. The initial modeling proposed in Chapter\~\ref{chap:ccgrid} focused in the operation for the short-term with one year of duration and the possibility to manufacture solar panels and lithium ion batteries to respectively generate renewable power and store it to deal with the intermitency of green power. The fisrt key aspect of the proposed solution is that it solves both sub problems --- sizing and operating --- as a single problem, alowing to evalute if the renewable infrastructure dimensions could be reduced by scheduling the workload to the different geographics locations using the follow-the-renwables approach. Another key aspect of the modeling is that it takes into account the specifc charactheristics of the geogpraphich locations of the DCs in terms of climate conditions --- the capacity to generate renewable power --- cooling needs, and the local grid electricity supply --- that may already have the presence of low-carbon intensive source. The final aspect is that the the proposed solution does not neglect the fact that manufacturing renewable infrastructure also presents a environmental impact. Through experiments using real-world data for workload, climate conditions, servers specifications, location of data centers, grid energy-mix,  we demonstrated that the hybrid solution using the on-site renewable infrastructure and aware of the specificities of each DC location is better in terms of carbon footprint than only operating the DCs using power from the local electricity grid or exclusively power from the on-site renewable infrastructure. We then extended our modeling for the long-term in Chapter\~ref{chap:ccgrid-extension}, considering that data centers have  a life time over one decade. We started by improving the modeling to consider the carbon footprint of the entire life cycle of the renewable infrastructure --- from manufacturing to discarding/recycling --- which is a more accurate information of the environmental impact and reduces the over-sizing of the renewable infrastructure. We also presented an evaluation of including wind power in the on site renewable sources, and demonstrated through experiments that despite being able to further reduce the carbon footprint, it might not be adequate for onsite renewable production given its requirment in terms of land-area, increasing the uncertainty of the sizing process, and the higher costs for on-shore wind production. Therefore PV panels are the best candidates for the on-site renewable infrastructure and lithium-ion batteries associated to store power  to use at night. We also showed that the sizing process is subject to errors given the uncertainty of the climate conditions, and that could be mitigated by the workload scheduling --- show in section x. In terms of costs, we showed that the hybrid configuration is already more cheaper than operating the DCs using power only from the local electricity grid, and that the solution with pv and batteries that aims to reduce the costs is the best cost benefit in terms of carbon footprint and costs for the cloud operators. For the decision of manufacturing new servers given the workload we saw that greedy approaches can be used with good results .. harder to predict workload and servers speciifications... which can have an impact on the decision ...


Our the experiments used real-world data for the workload, climate conditions, servers specificiations, cooling needs of DCs, energy mix, life cycle footprint, life cycle costs of the renewable infrastructure, price of the local electricity, carbon footprint of manufacturing servers ... and so on ...

Finally, the model was carefully conceived to use only linear variables, which alllows to be solved optimally in polynomial time and evaluating long-term scenarios with reasonlable time --- reducing the energy consumption and associated carbon footprint of the solution itself.


\section{Future Research Directions}

\label{sec:conclusion_future_research}


As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion_smargreens}, to further assess the impact of the follow-the-renewables strategies, we also need to take into account the network usage by the workload --- that  reduces the avaialable bandwitdh for the migration process. The model can also be analyzed for the container virtualization technology, since they are usually smaller in comparison to VMs, it coud result in more workload being migrated.

- Reciclar os servidores
- Outras camadas alem da cloud ...


Another important point to add in the model is the degradation of the renewable infrastructure, and the failure of IT equipments. The usage of GPU in cloud data centers is also growing by the years, this can also be inspected as future work, what are the footprint of manufacturing them, how much will their workload increase, and so on.


As we saw in Chapter\~ref{chap:smartgreens} applying follow-the-renewables to the long-running workload has signifcant potential for reducing the carbon emissions of the cloud operation. We didnt include it in our modeling for sizing and operating the globally distributed cloud data centers given the high latency between the links that interconencts these data centers, wich would apply a long running time for migrating the workload among these DCs. This analysis needs to be made to evaluate the potential of migrating the workload. One posibility could be to have a limit or migrate only batch tasks.


Another possibility is the decision where to install a new data center, considering its potential to generate renewable power, its energy-mix.REsulting in the necessary renewable infrastructure, and number of servers and IT equipments, aiming to reduce the carbon footprint.


Finally, the environmental impacts of cloud computing platforms does not only includes the carbon footprint, it presents as well impacts in terms of water usage, resource extraction and depletion for manufacturing the IT equipments, the discarding of equipments can also generate toxicity and so on. In the first moment, it is necessary to model this types of impacts to generate metrics that will permit to measure them. At a second step, it will be possible to propose solutions aiming to reducing them.


For example, we have metrics that evaluate the quality of the service, we could have metrics to measure the environmental impact of these service and applications as well.
